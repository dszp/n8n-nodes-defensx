description: put latest patch entry in CHANGELOG.md
---
Add new patch entry to CHANGELOG.md documenting the latest action. Bump the patchlevel and use today's date for the entry if it doesn't already exist and if the patch level has not been incremented since the latest package version; otherwise update the CHANGELOG entry for the currently in-progress version. If an existing entry exists for a new version but with a previous date, bump the date for that entry to today's date as well, when adding the entry to the existing updates.
